# Veterinary-Management-System
The Veterinary Management System is a full-stack web application designed to streamline communication between pet owners and veterinarians and to manage veterinary services efficiently.

For the backend, I used PHP for its efficiency in server-side scripting. MySQL was selected for the database due to its reliability and compatibility with PHP. The front end was built with HTML and CSS, ensuring a responsive and intuitive interface. Additionally, advanced AWS services were integrated for cloud functionality and scalability.

Key features of the system include appointment booking, access to medical records. The platform also includes administrative tools for veterinarians for managing appointments and patient information.
